# BAScii-Applied-AI
This repository is a project for Applied Artificial Intelligence Course in BAScii, Chulalongkorn University

This program utilises OCR technology to recognize patterns from designers as well as input handwritten designs into the Fabrix database in order to further make it easier for tailors to customize clothes while automatically generating quotations.

The program will start off in a Google spreadsheet, possessing only the initial sheet (sheet 0) as the starting point. After this, we will need one picture for the program to recognize. The tailor either defines the variables as an acronym-based measurement (size, B = 18.5, I = 1.75) or defines the parameters using actual fully-worded measurements and sizes (Across Shoulder = 18.5, Shoulder drop from HPS = 1.75). After running the code, it will generate a database in a new spreadsheet (sheet n) that contains the fully-worded measurements and size.
